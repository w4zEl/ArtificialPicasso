Hello! We are Mahjong, a small group of software engineering students at the University of Waterloo passionate about the integration of technology and art. *The Artificial Picasso* is a robot that sketches out a physical drawing based on an image. Our end goal for this project is to have a working robot arm that will take a photograph taken by our raspberry pi's webcam and draw the image on paper.
